<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Artspiration Screenshot](cool screenshot)
The backend of Artspiration consumes the Artsy API and Google Cloud Vision API to power a recommendation engine that connects users with exciting artwork based on their preferences. We expose endpoints that package up this material for frontend consumption to display to our users as a web application.


Learning Goals:
* Using an Agile process throughout development
* Setting up continuous integration and continous deployment
* Using project management tool Github Project
* Demoing project ot project manager
* Building a backend API for frontend consumption
* Consuming endpoints and manipulating the JSON responses
* Handling large group dynamics with short 3 day sprints
* Working with Machine Learning outputs and implementing into app
* Consuming Google Cloud Vision API

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To run this project localy please follow the instructions below. *Maybe adjust this link to endpoints link?* For production environment go to: [Artspiration](https://peaceful-reef-61917.herokuapp.com/)


### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [Artsy API](https://api.artsy.net)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/marlitas/ArtspirationBE.git
   ```
3. Install gems
   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```
4. Install figaro
    ```sh
   bundle exec figaro install
   ```
5. Enter your API in `application.yml`
   ```ruby
   artsy_api_key = <ENTER YOUR API>
   google_api_key = <ENTER YOUR API>
   ```
6. Setup the database
    ```sh
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
The Artspiration Backend can be used to retrieve user preferences for artwork, as well as make calls to the Artsy API for specific artwork information including: title, artist, image(jpg), creation date. The backend can also provide daily recommendations for a piece of art based on past user preferences. Preferences are generated through label and image properties determined by the Google Cloud Vision API. The recommendation engine is built using a combination of collaborative filtering as well as sorting through the saved user preferences. 

### Endpoint Documentation
