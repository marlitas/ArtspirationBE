<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Artspiration Screenshot](cool screenshot)
The backend of Artspiration consumes the Artsy API and Google Cloud Vision API to power a recommendation engine that connects users with exciting artwork based on their preferences. We expose endpoints that package up this material for frontend consumption to display to our users as a web application.


Learning Goals:
* Using an Agile process throughout development
* Setting up continuous integration and continous deployment
* Using project management tool Github Project
* Demoing project ot project manager
* Building a backend API for frontend consumption
* Consuming endpoints and manipulating the JSON responses
* Handling large group dynamics with short 3 day sprints
* Working with Machine Learning outputs and implementing into app
* Consuming Google Cloud Vision API
